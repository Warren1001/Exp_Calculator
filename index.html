  <h3>v0.1.0</h3>
  <p>Last updated for: D2R PTR 2.5 v1</p>
  <p>Primarily developed by Warren1001 from Llama's community. You can contact me <a href="https://discord.gg/mrllamasc">on his Discord server</a> or DM me directly on Discord (Warren#2433).</p>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/Warren1001/Exp_Calculator/tree/master">This calculator is open source</a>. <a href="https://github.com/Warren1001/Exp_Calculator/issues">Report a bug if you find one</a>. <a href="https://github.com/Warren1001/Exp_Calculator/blob/master/README.md">Changelog</a></p>
  <p>Every time you visit this page for the first time, or you see mention of me updating this version, please full refresh with CTRL + F5.</p>
  <p>This will look very rough until I have time to flesh it out. It's currently set to show experience you would receive if you were level 98, in a 8 player game, but in a solo party. I'll add customization options in the future.</p>
