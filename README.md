## [D2R Terrorization Experience Calculator](https://warren1001.github.io/Exp_Calculator/)

Credits to Amazon Basin and co. for the entire experience algorithm.

### v1.2.0
- Fixed areas listed and changed to match the second PTR.
- Bug: this calculator still shows XP overflows, which Blizzard fixed. I don't have a way to test this at the moment, so I don't know how to correct the logic.

### v1.1.1
- Very close to being correct now.

### v1.1.0
- Blizzard sucks. Experience gain is much higher than originally thought. Why can't they just say what they changed exactly?

### v1.0.0
- Only show areas impacted by Terror Zones.
- Added a bunch of number options.
- Used the correct monster level for terrorized champion and unique monsters.
- Added tooltips to the table headers to explain what they mean.

### v0.1.0
- Initial release.
- Only shows experience for level 98 player in a 8 player game but solo party in a Hell game.
- Monsters shown are all monsters that can spawn by default in Hell.
